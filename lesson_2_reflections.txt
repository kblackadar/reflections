What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, you set up the repository so that when you
commits you will store each of these commits and will be able to access previous
commits in the future if needed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where files that you want to commit go.  The working
directory is where the files you are working on are located.  You do not have
to place all the files in your working directory in the staging area.  You can
choose which file(s) to place there. The repository is the history of all the
commits you have done and versions of all the files you are working on.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
