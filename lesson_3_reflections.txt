When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local if I wanted to share work with others or wanted to receive
feedback from others regarding my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually from my remote repository because there could be changes that are on my remote repository that I or
another user has made that I am not ready to have on my own version on Git.
