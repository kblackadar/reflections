When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all the work local if I wanted to share work with others or wanted to receive
feedback from others regarding my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually from my remote repository because there could be changes that are on my remote repository that I or
another user has made that I am not ready to have on my own version on Git.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub.  A clone is a copy of a repository either on Git or GitHub.  A branch is a commit
that is points to a different path in your series of commits.  For example, you would create a fork of someone's repository on GitHub
if you didn't have permission to modify or didn't want to modify someone else's repository on GitHub.  You would clone a repository
if you wanted to create a copy of a repository, either from GitHub onto your local machine or from your machine to your machine.  You
would create a branch if you wanted to create another version of a program, possibly to modify some of the features of that program to
create a different version of the program or to test code before adding it to the current branch.
